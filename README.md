# dev-env
## Instructions
To use the environment, clone or download the whole thing to the Flash Drive you'll be using to program. 

If you're having a bad time, try installing all of them manually with the installers in this [folder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwan1dCB81DEcVJSNmhNLWVDcEU/view?usp=sharing)

If you're bringing a laptop to class, I just recommend installing all of these locally on your machine. Here are the links to all of the programs:
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- If you want a GUI for Git, I recommend [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
- You only need one text editor, check out the following:
  - [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) (Very good for UI styling b/c of its live preview feature)
  - [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
  - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)
